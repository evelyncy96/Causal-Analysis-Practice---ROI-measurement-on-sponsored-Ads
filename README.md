# Causal-Analysis-Practice : ROI-measurement-on-sponsored-Ads

**Project Background**: This is my very first causal inference practice using Difference-In-Difference techniques to check whether there is causal affect between sponsored search ads and Organic clicks on Google search platform.

**Feature used**
* platform: Search platform where the ads were released
* week: Timeline, from week1 to week 12
* avg_spons: Average number of clicks on the sponsored search ads
* avg_org: Average number of clicks on the Organic search

**Treatment and Control Group**
* Treatment: We defined the searching platform Google as a treatment group. 
* Control: We defined all the other platforms (Bing, yahoo, ask) as control groups.
